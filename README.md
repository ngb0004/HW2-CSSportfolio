# HW2-CSS Portfolio

I created an responsive CSS file that changes at 3 break points (980px, 768px, 640px)
## Description

The page contains 3 pages that all link to one another through the Navbar.
The first page is an about me that has a picture and a short summary about me.
The second page is a portfolio that has a few of the projects I've worked on recently
The third page is a contact page that isn't interactive yet but will be in the future.

## Usage

Show off my projects and achievements to potential employers.

Give links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and some other contact info.
