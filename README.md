# HW2-CSS Portfolio

I created an responsive CSS file that changes at 3 break points (980px, 768px, 640px)
## Description

The page contains 3 pages that all link to one another through the Navbar.
The first page is an about me that has a picture and a short summary about me.
The second page is a portfolio that has a few pictures where I hope to put real projects in the future.
The third page is a contact page that isn't interactive yet but will be in the future.

## Usage

I used HTML, CSS, bootstrap, flex-box, fontawesome, and a few random images in order to get everything up and running. I wish i would have done a few things differently with the images in my portfolio but I think the other 2 pages are pretty spot on.
